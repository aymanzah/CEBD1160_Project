## Research Question

How to predict housing prices using the provided dataset features or a subset of these features?

### Abstract

This project is based on the Boston Housing Dataset collected in 1978 which contains data related to houses in the city of Boston. As a part of my journey learning big data and machine learning I worked on this dataset to predict the housing prices based on the correlation between the dataset features and using statistical methods such as Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor as well as measure the performance of these predictions.

### Introduction

The Boston Housing Dataset was chosen after reviewing a number of available datasets at Scikit learn where I considered it a very suitable one to explore and analyze. The dataset can be accessed and used from the scikit-learn library [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#boston-house-prices-dataset). It consists of 506 sample records for 13 numeric/categorical predictive. Median Value (attribute 14) is usually the target.

| Name    | Description
| --------|--------------
| CRIM    | Per capita crime rate by town
| ZN      | Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
| INDUS   | Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
| CHAS    | Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
| NOX     | Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
| RM      | Average number of rooms per dwelling
| AGE     | Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
| DIS     | Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
| RAD     | Index of accessibility to radial highways
| TAX     | Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
| PTRATIO | Pupil-teacher ratio by town
| B       | 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
| LSTAT   | % lower status of the population
| MEDV    | Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
